              <p>
                Marker-based AR requires a visual marker, such as a QR code or image, to trigger the AR experience. It is commonly used in print ads and product packaging to display 3D models when scanned.

              <p>
                Markerless AR does not require a visual marker and instead uses sensors and GPS to trigger AR experiences based on real-world surroundings. This type is often used in navigation and interactive shopping apps.

              <p>
                Projection-based AR projects light onto physical surfaces to create interactive experiences. It can be used for presentations, virtual product displays, and interactive installations.

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-customRed">Superimposition-Based AR</h3>
              <p>
                This type of AR superimposes digital information onto a real-world environment in real-time. Itâ€™s widely used in industries like healthcare (for surgical planning) and automotive (for augmented repair instructions).
