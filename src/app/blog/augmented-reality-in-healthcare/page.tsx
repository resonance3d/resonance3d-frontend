              <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">What is Augmented Reality in Healthcare?</h2>
              <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                AR in healthcare involves the use of technology to overlay digital information onto the real
                world. This can include 3D models, data visualizations, and interactive elements that assist
                medical professionals in diagnosing, treating, and training. By combining the digital and physical
                worlds, AR enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of medical procedures, offering real-time
                support and guidance.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Key Applications of AR in Healthcare</h2>
              <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                AR is revolutionizing several aspects of healthcare. Below are some of the key applications that
                are improving patient care and transforming medical practices:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <b>Medical Training:</b> AR helps train medical students and professionals by simulating
                  realistic procedures and offering immersive learning experiences. Medical students can interact
                  with 3D models of organs, muscles, and bones, helping them understand human anatomy in a
                  dynamic, hands-on way.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Surgical Assistance:</b> Surgeons can use AR to enhance precision during operations. AR overlays
                  crucial information such as 3D models of organs, blood vessels, or tumors onto the patientâ€™s body
                  in real time, helping the surgeon make more informed decisions and reducing risks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Remote Assistance:</b> AR allows healthcare professionals to consult with specialists remotely
                  during surgeries or medical procedures, improving the quality of care in underserved or remote
                  areas.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Patient Education:</b> AR is being used to help patients understand their medical conditions
                  and treatment options. Interactive 3D models allow patients to visualize their condition and
                  treatment process, making it easier to communicate complex information.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Diagnostics:</b> AR enhances diagnostic accuracy by providing additional data or 3D visual
                  models for conditions like fractures, tumors, or neurological diseases, making diagnoses more
                  precise and actionable.
                </li>
              </ul>
