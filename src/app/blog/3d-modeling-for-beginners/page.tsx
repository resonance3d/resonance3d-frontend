              <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">What is 3D Modeling?</h2>
              <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                3D modeling is the process of creating a three-dimensional representation of objects
                using specialized software. These models are used in various industries such as
                gaming, animation, architecture, and product design.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Essential Tips for Beginners</h2>
              <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Starting with 3D modeling can feel overwhelming, but these tips will help you build
                confidence and improve your skills:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <b>Choose the Right Software:</b> Start with beginner-friendly tools like Blender
                  (free) or TinkerCAD. As you progress, you can explore more advanced options like
                  Maya or 3ds Max.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Master Basic Shapes:</b> Everything in 3D modeling begins with basic shapes like
                  cubes, spheres, and cylinders. Learn to manipulate these shapes to create complex
                  designs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Understand Topology:</b> Good topology ensures that your models are clean and
                  efficient, especially when animating or rendering.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Use Reference Images:</b> Always work with reference images to guide your
                  designs and maintain accuracy.
